brew install python@3.11
I initially installed Python 3.13 (a development version not yet officially released), which caused frequent errors 
when installing PcbDraw and its dependencies because many third-party libraries did not yet provide pre-built wheels for 3.13.
brew install --cask kicad
brew install pkg-config cairo pango gdk-pixbuf libffi harfbuzz fribidi librsvg
cd ~/Desktop  
mkdir pcb && cd pcb
python3.11 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
pip install pcbdraw
pcbdraw --help
P.S. The above statements apply only to the iOS system and KiCad version 6.0.0.
