This issue occurs on Apple computers because macOS requires all external programs to be signed. 
While KiCAD installed via Homebrew is signed, installing plugins with binary dependencies invalidates the signature, 
which prevents KiKit from running.

The current solution is to re-sign KiCAD after installing KiKit. Therefore, installing KiKit on macOS involves two steps:
1.Creating a self-signed certificate  
2.Installing KiKit and re-signing KiCAD

Method 1: Create a Code Signing Certificate  
Open the Keychain Access application and select "Create a Certificate."
